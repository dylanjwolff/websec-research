1. Use content script to alter sensitive DOM values
2. Use prebuilt sandboxing to render page safely (ADSafe within an iframe maybe?)
    a) iframe.child = new doc, with child set to document.getChild(). Document.setAllChild undefined, Document.setChild[1] = iframe
    b) issue: if cookie is set by the original page, this doesn't help
3. Inject script into the DOM and override calls
4. Modify JS Execution Engine to add a compilation step with Caja etc.

For network requests,,, chrome.webRequest API
